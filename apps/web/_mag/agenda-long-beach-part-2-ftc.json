Kent started out selling skateboards in the original FTC (Free Trade Commission) sporting goods store (owned by Kent&#8217;s pops) on Bush Street, before moving FTC first to its Shrader location and then to FTC&#8217;s Haight location in 1994. With San Francisco emerging as the &#8217;90s mecca for skateboarding, FTC has long been associated with SF&#8217;s iconic spots like EMB, Hubba Hideout, Pier 7 and more through its iconic videos (Penal Code 101A, A Fine Line Between Love and Haight, Finally), and played a significant role in shaping and influencing the aesthetic and evolution of modern skateboarding. With franchises in Barcelona, Tokyo and Sendai; and with Western Edition Skateboards under the FTC family umbrella, the FTC brand has an enviable global reach with it&#8217;s carefully chosen collaborations as well as easily recognizable aesthetics and well thought out designs. I had the opportunity to spend some time at the FTC booth at Agenda 2015 Long Beach, and got to check out the upcoming line.</p>\n<p><em>Lucas holding it down in the FTC booth.

Some of my personal favorites were the following two renditions of the classic FTC logo t-shirts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1904\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/IMG_5864.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5864\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/IMG_5864.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/IMG_5864.jpg 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/IMG_5864.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1903\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_225/mag/uploads/IMG_5863-e1437733590743.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5863\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_225/mag/uploads/IMG_5863-e1437733590743.jpg 225w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_768/mag/uploads/IMG_5863-e1437733590743.jpg 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/IMG_5863-e1437733590743.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Lucas walked me through their upcoming line and he and Kent also talked about some upcoming pieces that you&#8217;d definitely want to keep an eye out for. One of those pieces, the Hosoi Skateboards x FTC collaboration &#8220;Haight&#8221; Hammerhead t-shirt was especially cool, and definitely brought back that late-80s/early-90s vibe where transition skating was huge.</p>\n<p><em>Lucas with the Hosoi Skateboards x FTC collaboration &#8220;Haight&#8221; Hammerhead t-shirt.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1906\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_225/mag/uploads/IMG_5866-e1437734037853.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5866\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_225/mag/uploads/IMG_5866-e1437734037853.jpg 225w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_768/mag/uploads/IMG_5866-e1437734037853.jpg 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/IMG_5866-e1437734037853.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another unusual item in the line definitely worth checking out is the FTC x Mac Dre t-shirt.

Remember all that epic Lavar, Stevie, Marcus, JB, Brad, Rob, Henry and Enrique footage and many more SF heads? You know I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to seeing more of thatÂ  that! If it&#8217;s anything like what I&#8217;m hoping for, it&#8217;s gonna be crazy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1905\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/IMG_5865.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5865\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/IMG_5865.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/IMG_5865.jpg 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/IMG_5865.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thank you Lucas and Kent for taking the time to talk to me about FTC&#8217;s and Western Edition&#8217;s lines, everything&#8217;s looking really good! &#8211; HK</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","author":"kev","categories":["event"],"tags":["emb","ftc","haight","hosoi-skateboards","hubba-hideout","kent-ueyhara","lucas-erlebach","mac-dre","pier-7","san-francisco"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"IMG_5862.jpg","width":2816,"height":2112,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/IMG_5862.jpg"}],"video":""}
