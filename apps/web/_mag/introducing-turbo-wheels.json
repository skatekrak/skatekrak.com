Period. And choosing the right hardness according to your style and preferences definitely takes some time. When we talked to Julien Bachelier (<a href=\"http://www.antizskateboards.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antiz</a> founder and now Turbo Wheels founder as well) back in issue 8 of KrakMag we were stoked to know they were just about to launch a new wheel brand. And we were even happier when we heard they used Urethane measured on a B scale: 83B. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/152880095\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Julien</a> told us he had been skating the same set of wheels for the past 3 months. We had to introduce them to you so we included some in the <a href=\"https://krakbox.com/shop/product/385527356\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Euro Tour box</a> and we hope you enjoyed riding them!</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2849\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2849\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2849\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/TURBO-PETER_MOLEC_SW_FS_NOSEGRIND_ATHENS.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Wheels - Peter Molec\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/TURBO-PETER_MOLEC_SW_FS_NOSEGRIND_ATHENS.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/TURBO-PETER_MOLEC_SW_FS_NOSEGRIND_ATHENS.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2849\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peter Molec, switch f/s nosegrind.

As for the team: Peter Molec, Thanos Panou, Vincent Coupeau and Jerôme Chevalier have our back. Everything takes time, but what matters most is to offer a quality wheel. By the way, folks, you are the very first to ride them&#8230; we look forward to hearing what you think! This is how we’ll evolve.”</p>\n<p>Now they have a website which you can check out <a href=\"http://www.turboskateco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2850\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2850\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2850\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/TURBO-THANOS_PANOU_FS_50_50_CANYELLES_6X6.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Wheels - Thanos Panou\" width=\"680\" height=\"692\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/TURBO-THANOS_PANOU_FS_50_50_CANYELLES_6X6.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_295/mag/uploads/TURBO-THANOS_PANOU_FS_50_50_CANYELLES_6X6.jpg 295w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thanos Panou, f/s 50-50.
