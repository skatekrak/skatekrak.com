About Treepod.</h4>\n<p>Hugo Bernatas, I&#8217;m 23 and I&#8217;m studying filmmaking in Lyon. I create on my own many and varied <a href=\"http://hugobernatas.com\" target=\"_blank\">video projects</a> (music clips, skateboarding videos, institutionnal movies, live,&#8230;). Tree Prod is a collective which permits to join together artists, but most of all, friends, in order to help each others and work on a common project.</p>\n<h4>How did you start filming/editing videos?</h4>\n<p>I started filming when I had my first DV camera. I started by filming my friends skateboarding. The year after that, I made some video clips to tell about each day of the festival “Rockomotives”. This is really when I started working for myself, and began to developp new projects.</p>\n<h4>Who inspired you the most?</h4>\n<p>My inspiration for skatebording videos is <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/jayfilms\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Hernandez</a>, the director of the Nike SB&#8217;s videos. But I&#8217;m also inspired by a lot of artists on Vimeo. They really make the best videos! And sometimes, simply walking down the street can inspire me&#8230;</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/92851200?color=020303\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h4>Any funny behind-the-scenes story?</h4>\n<p>Not really! But I can&#8217;t count all the skateboards which ended on my camera lens&#8230;</p>\n<h4>What has been your favorite thing about using <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\">Krak</a>?</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s great to find some spots, and it&#8217;s really helpfull when I&#8217;m looking for a new place to film which isn&#8217;t ten miles away!</p>\n<h4>Any useful shooting tips for our Homies?</h4>\n<p>Try to find original angles but more important, enjoy yourself</p>\n<h4>What are you up to (your projects or wish)?</h4>\n<p>This month, I&#8217;m going to make a video part for <a href=\"http://arkaic-concept.fr\" target=\"_blank\">Arkaïc Skateboard</a>, and in January, I&#8217;ll probably realize a music video in London, but I can&#8217;t say more for now !</p>\n<h4>Thanks Hugo, best of luck in your projects and keep pushin&#8217;</h4>\n<pre class=\"alert success\">Check him out : KRAK app &gt; Menu &gt; Find Skaters &gt; Hugo B</pre>\n<p>Copyrights: Hugo Bernatas<br />\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/hugobernatas\" target=\"_blank\">@HugoBernatas<br />\n</a>Discover Hugo&#8217;s videos on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/hugobernatas\" target=\"_blank\">Vimeo</a></p>\n","author":"kev","categories":["interviews","krakens"],"tags":["best-pictures","homies","inspiration-2","krak-app","lyon","photography"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"featured-pic21.jpg","width":1100,"height":733,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/featured-pic21.jpg"}],"video":""}
