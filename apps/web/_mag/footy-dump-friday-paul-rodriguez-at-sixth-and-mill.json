Check. Nollie front foot flip? Check.</h3>\n<p>In each episode of Footy Dump, we&#8217;ll take a look at previously lost or never before seen footage of skateboarding radness. In this installment, we check out some unseen footage of Paul Rodriguez at Nike SB&#8217;s Sixth and Mill facility from 7 July 2013. This was right at the beginning of the renaissance of front foot flips, at the launch of the P-Rod 7 Skate Safari, and before there was even <a href=\"http://primitiveskate.com\" target=\"_blank\">Primitive Skateboarding</a>. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/skatekrak\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-907 size-medium\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/P-Rod_sixthandmill-2.png\" alt=\"P-Rod_sixthandmill 2\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/P-Rod_sixthandmill-2.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/P-Rod_sixthandmill-2.png 745w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a> P-Rod took it to a whole other level with a backside crooked grind to nollie front foot flip out. Yep, you read that right!! Say that fast three times. BOOM!!! Yes, this is PRETTY DAMN <a href=\"http://skatekrak.com\" target=\"_blank\">KRAKED</a>! Definitely a face melter right there and the Krak team was lucky enough to have been there to witness this. As a bonus, this was also one of the first sightings of P-Rod&#8217;s infamous &#8220;Gold&#8221; boards. We still got a couple more clips from that day stacked, so check out the clip below and stay tuned!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLwogtmeZiQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Images: Â© Krak</p>\n","author":"kev","categories":["rdmn"],"tags":["footy-dump","nike-sb","paul-rodriguez","sixth-and-mill","skateboard","skateboarding"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"P-Rod_sixthandmill-2.png","width":745,"height":553,"mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/P-Rod_sixthandmill-2.png"}],"video":""}
