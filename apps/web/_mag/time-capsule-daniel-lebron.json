There in Madrid, he eventually met the brothers Alfonso and Jesus Fernandez at Corona Square and ultimately moved with them to Los Angeles to chase the dream of becoming a professional skateboarder. After a stint in the States, Dani moved back to Madrid and then to Barcelona in 2012, where he now resides. In addition to his amazing abilities on the board, Dani is also an accomplished Flamenco guitar player(he was admitted to the Conservatoire to study Flamenco guitar). Dani has also been quietly killin&#8217; it on his skateboard for an unbelievably long career, and Dani&#8217;s classic parts in Neighboorhoods LaLa Land (1998) and the L.A. County(2000) videos are amazing even by today&#8217;s standards, definitely having stood the test of time.</p>\n<p><em>Daniel in Neighborhood&#8217;s LaLa Land(1998).</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k30w-YFlRNI?start=114&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The opening line in his L.A. County part sets the tone for what&#8217;s to come, with a backtail, a kickflip noseslide revert, a switch tre and a frontside halfcab heelflip all stomped as smooth as they come. The footage at the USC blocks alone is priceless, and Dani&#8217;s footage there is a prime example of the technical finesse and ledge wizardry he is known for.</p>\n<p><em>Daniel in L.A. County(2000).</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0St1FKalC7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>With stints on Neighborhood Skateboards, almost getting on Girl/Chocolate alongside Jesus Fernandez, a pro stint on Michael Leon&#8217;s short-lived Commonwealth Stacks(his welcome to Stacks video still remains one of our favorites for overall editing and feel), and now finally with a stable home on Boulevard skateboards, Dani shows no sign of slowing down with both his skateboarding and music careers.</p>\n<p><em>Stacks Welcomes Dani Lebron(2011).</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/19897297\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Stacks Welcomes Dani Lebron\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Dani for UNO#61.</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/76937147\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Tras la Portada UNO#61\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>Music and skateboarding go well together</h3>\n<p>Dani, Jesus Fernandez and Julian Lorenzo recently traveled around Andalucia in Southern Spain, skating perfect plazas by day and playing in Flamenco clubs by night, as part of the <a href=\"http://theridechannel.com/news/2015/01/flamenco-tour-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Flamenco Tour</a>.</p>\n<p>Not one to constantly overwhelm us with a barrage of footage, Dani quietly puts out quality parts that leave us asking for more. His latest part for Nike SB, &#8220;Not Bad At All&#8221; is a perfect showcase of the kind of technical skateboarding Dani has been known for, with one of the most perfect frontside heelflips on flat we&#8217;ve ever seen(at 2:43) mid-line after a switch frontside 180 over the first ledge, and ending with a fakie flip switch backside crooks. Talk about a crazy line!</p>\n<p>Dani in Nike SB&#8217;s #notbadatall(2013)</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8WRWYK2X4g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Thank you Dani for the many years of inspiration and for changing our notions of longevity in a professional skateboarding career.
