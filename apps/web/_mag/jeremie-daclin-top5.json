He was the guy responsible for putting European skateboarding on the map when he launched Cliché. Since that’s wrapped up, what’s next for the slappy enthusiast from Lyon?

Today, Film Trucks is reborn—rising from its ashes with unique and original designs. Film Trucks are made to carve, built for slappies, grinding pool copping and having fun on any DIY obstacles.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>From the man that just keeps giving to skateboarding, here are Jeremie Daclin’s Slappy Top Five’s&#8230;</strong></em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3652\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Gégé.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3652\" class=\"wp-image-3652 size-full\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Gégé.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Gégé.jpg 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Gégé.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_768/mag/uploads/Gégé.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3652\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">JEREMIE DACLIN. photo: RAM D&#8217;ANNECY</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>SLAPPY LEGENDS</strong></span><br />\n1 &#8211; The Fellows Union Curb Club (LA Crew with Chris Pastras, CurbKiller, Scott Herskovitz, Abe Bethel, Tim Olson, Jason Hernandez and more).<br />\n2 &#8211; Lance Mountain and Neil Blender in the “Ban This” video.<br />\n3 &#8211; Jon Lucero because he invented them.<br />\n4 &#8211; Jason Adams The Kid.<br />\n5 &#8211; Everyone who waxes a curb and makes it skateable.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>SLAPPY TIPS</strong></span><br />\n1 &#8211; Get your best friends together for the best slappy sessions.<br />\n2 &#8211; Loosen your trucks!<br />\n3 &#8211; Make sure the curb slides.
