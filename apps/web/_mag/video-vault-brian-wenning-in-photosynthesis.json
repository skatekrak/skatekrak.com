Still influential to this day, this part might single-handedly be responsible for popularizing the OG DC Lynx back in the day. With an effortless style, lines for days, ridiculously controlled backside nosegrinds with the proper pop out, and properly caught nollie backheels against the Mr Dibbs beat, Brian&#8217;s impact on modern skateboarding is undeniable. And with the backdrop of skating Philly&#8217;s Love Park in its heyday, this short part was key in re-introducing technical multiple trick lines back into the skateboarding lexicon. That Brian had switch backsmiths and switch backtails like that obviously didn&#8217;t hurt either. To put this part in perspective, this came out in 2000, so most of the footage predated this. The boards skated during this era were in the 7.4&#8243;-7.6&#8243; range, and we definitely saw a far greater variety of concaves and shapes among decks. The emphasis then was on clean technical lines(lots of switch and nollies) but without the late-flips of the early 90s. And that switch tre at the Brooklyn Banks 9 stair was certainly an ender to remember. Definitely a part to re-watch, we present to you, Brian Wenning.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTtzEDxk2ks?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","author":"kev","categories":["reviews"],"tags":["alien-workshop","brian-wenning","dc-shoes","habitat","love-park","new-york","philly","video-vault"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"Brian-Wenning-1.png","width":1090,"height":613,"mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Brian-Wenning-1.png"}],"video":""}
