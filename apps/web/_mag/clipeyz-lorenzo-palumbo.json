So last year when we asked ClipEyz about chatting to one of their riders, it was a no-brainer for us: let’s talk to Lorenzo. This great kid isn’t only a good skater, he’s a nice dude and definitely forms a cool team with his father Carlo. You’ll see more of him in the near future for sure. -k</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Hey Lorenzo, how old are you? where are you from?<br />\n</strong></span>I’m 13 years old and I’m from Hyeres-les-Palmiers in France.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>When did you start skating?<br />\n</strong></span>I started when I was 8 years old so I’ve been skating for almost four and a half years now.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>How did you start?<br />\n</strong></span>Thanks to my brother and one of his friends. I haven&#8217;t stopped since.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Your favorite trick?<br />\n</strong></span>Pressure flip, treflip and b/s flip.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2888\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2888\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2888\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Lorenzo-3.jpg\" alt=\"Lorenzo Palumbo, f/s boardslide.
