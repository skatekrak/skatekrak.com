Isn’t it awesome to have a clear and simple app for skateboarding pictures and videos? We truly aim at offering you the best experience possible so we have been working hard on new features that totally transform our world into an amazing playground for skateboarders.</p>\n<h2><strong>#1 Explore</strong></h2>\n<p>You may have noticed a new “explore sign” on the home page. This is the most exciting feature ever! Go find out new spots and identify clearly if it is street, park, shop or private spot thanks to their pictograms. You are now able to check a spot and vizualise real pictures shot by the Krak community. This is powerful and priceless. But wait ? <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Yeah the app is free!</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://188.166.61.196/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/spots-map-explore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-178\" src=\"http://188.166.61.196/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/spots-map-explore.jpg\" alt=\"spots map explore\" width=\"602\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/spots-map-explore.jpg 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/spots-map-explore.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/spots-map-explore.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>#2 Add favorite spots to your Wishlist</strong></h2>\n<p>We all dream of skating golden spots like <em>West LA Court House</em>, <em>Venice Skatepark</em>, <em>Stoner Plaza</em>, <em>Republique</em>…but even more to find the sickest spot ever downtown.
