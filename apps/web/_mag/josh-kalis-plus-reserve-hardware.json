The thing is he’s not only the awesome skateboarder who put Philly&#8217;s Love Park on the map (and on his arm with a nice tattoo of the Love sculpture designed by Robert Indiana). He’s also a great entrepreneur and developed the most innovative hardware on the market today: Plus Reserve.</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.plus-reserve.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plus Reserve Hardware</a> features a custom head that works easily with both an allen key and a phillips screwdriver.</em></p>\n<p><em>Josh nicely gave us some bolts last year when we were skating out at Jkwon in Los Angeles and we never stopped to use them ever since. High quality we can assure you.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Age:</strong></span> 39<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Hometown:</strong></span> Grand Rapids, MI<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Number of years skating:</strong></span> 27 years<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>How did you start:</strong></span> saw a kid skating in the 6th grade.

So I thought it&#8217;d be sick to create a bolt that gives you either option: allen/phillips. I brought the idea to my buddy in the car world who does CAD design. He did some measurements and BOOM. The idea became reality.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Who’s on the team:</strong></span> I have been giving them to whoever wants them&#8230; And haven&#8217;t really locked down a actual team. Dane Vaughn, Mike Hoag, Morgan Smith, Dylan Sourbeer, a whole bunch of people are rocking them across the US.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>1 anecdote since the brand creation:</strong></span> My patent went through&#8230; So I won&#8217;t be nice to copy cats any longer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2771\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2771\" class=\"wp-image-2771\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/bolts-e1504822090705.jpg\" alt=\"Plus Reserve skate hardware\" width=\"680\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/bolts-e1504822090705.jpg 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/bolts-e1504822090705.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_768/mag/uploads/bolts-e1504822090705.jpg 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/bolts-e1504822090705.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2771\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plus Reserve skate hardware</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Last video you watched:</strong></span> <a href=\"http://skateboarding.transworld.net/tag/sabotage-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sabotage 4</a><br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>AM who should be pro:</strong></span> hard to say&#8230; I don&#8217;t make those choices, you know.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Favorite trick:</strong></span> 360 flip<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Favorite spot:</strong></span> currently Jkwon.
