There was a tiny skatepark in my new neighborhood, like, 200m away from my new house. It was time for me to start and I never stopped since!<br />\n<b>What’s your favorite trick?<br />\n</b>I would say Treflip.<br />\n<b>Who&#8217;s your favorite skater?<br />\n</b>Definitely Shane O’Neil! He’s so fluid, so smooth&#8230;<br />\n<b>What&#8217;s your favorite spot you ever skated?<br />\n</b>MACBA, Barcelona.<br />\n<b>And what&#8217;s the skate spot you never skated but dream about?<br />\n</b>Any of the big US spots I see everytime I watch a vid…<br />\n<b>What’s your favorite thing in skateboarding?<br />\n</b>Riding with friends, this is basically the best thing in skateboarding.<br />\n<strong>And what do you hate the most in skateboarding ?<br />\n</strong>Scooters in skateparks, France’s full of that. Oh, and these guys who buy a board to sit on it&#8230; I don’t get it.<br />\n<b>How did you first hear about Krak and the App ?<br />\n</b>I discovered Krak on Instagram, via a friend’s like or something like that.<br />\n<b>While talking about Instagram, what’s yours?<br />\n</b><a href=\"https://instagram.com/robknowskate/\" target=\"_blank\">@robknowskate</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><br />\n</span><b>Alright Robin, any shoutouts?<br />\n</b>Thanks mom, thanks skateboarding.</p>\n<p><em>Robin rides for himself but for Organic Clothing too.<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3TFRPe0WwY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n_</p>\n<h2><b>Joseph Garbaccio ♦ </b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/josephmag.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1688\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/josephmag.jpg\" alt=\"josephmag\" width=\"740\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/josephmag.jpg 740w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/josephmag.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a><br />\n<b><strong>How old are you</strong>?<br />\n</b>I just turned 17.<br />\n<b>Where are you from?<br />\n</b>I’m from Le Havre, France.<br />\n<b>When and how did you start skateboarding?<br />\n</b>I think I really started when I was 8. My brother was skateboarding since quite a long time so one day I decided to try. Now it&#8217;s been 10 years on my board and I don’t plan to stop.<br />\n<b>What’s your favorite trick?<br />\n</b>I wouldn’t say I have a favorite trick… I like doing hardflip, does it count?<br />\n<b>Who&#8217;s your favorite skater?<br />\n</b>Probably Curren Caples. He’s versatile. Man can rip bowl and park as well as the dirtiest street spot. I really like his style though.<br />\n<b>Is there a spot that you never skated but dream about?<br />\n</b>I never went to Barcelona but it seems to be the perfect place to skate.<br />\n<b>What’s your favorite thing in skateboarding?<br />\n</b>Traveling with a sponsor or for a contest. There’s always a crazy atmosphere, you meet new people and above all, you discover new spots!<br />\n<b>What do you hate the most in skateboarding?<br />\n</b>The trendy aspect of it. Like, people buying boards but not being interested in the culture… It’s pointless to me.<br />\n<b>How did you first hear about Krak and the App ?<br />\n</b>Some friends already were on the app, I liked the idea so I joined!<br />\n<b>Any other social account other than our app where people can see more of you?<br />\n</b>Check me on <a href=\"https://instagram.com/joseph_garbaccio/\" target=\"_blank\">Insta</a>.<br />\n<b>Shoutouts?<br />\n</b>Everyone who supports me and my sponsors: Jart Skateboards, DC shoes, GoPro, Stance, New Era, XSories, Industrees, Sport maximum.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2G7wjBmd99A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n_</p>\n<h2><b>Jeremiah Belledin ♦ </b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/jere1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1692\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/jere1.jpg\" alt=\"jere1\" width=\"740\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/jere1.jpg 740w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/jere1.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a><br />\n<b><strong>How old are you</strong>?<br />\n</b><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">19.<br />\n</span><b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Where are you from?<br />\n</b>I&#8217;m from Big Bear California, but I&#8217;m now living in Rancho Cucamonga California.<br />\n<b>When and how did you start skateboarding?<br />\n</b>I started skating when I was 9. I got inspired by growing up watching my neighbors do it all the time. And the steez they put into their tricks, man, I had to try.<br />\n<b>What’s your favorite trick?<br />\n</b>Casper flip and melon.<b><br />\n</b><b>Who’s your favorite skater?<br />\n</b>Definitely Wes Kremer. Because he has the indefinite steez. Also Chris Haslam just because he&#8217;s the rawest dude out there even in his age and day.<br />\n<b>Do you have any favorite skate spot?<br />\n</b>It’s a local secret spot out here in California called Badlands.<br />\n<b>And what is the spot you never skated but dream about?<br />\n</b>I’d love to travel to the east coast and skate any spots out there, really.<br />\n<b>What’s your favorite thing in skateboarding?<br />\n</b>What I love the most about skateboarding is how individualistic it is and how no skater is the same yet it brings every culture together.<br />\n<b>The thing you hate the most in skateboarding?<br />\n</b>I don’t really like how mainstream culture is slowly changing what skateboarding is about and represents.<br />\n<b>How did you first hear about Krak and the app?<br />\n</b>I heard about Krak when you guys contacted me right after I did the fifteen boards!<br />\n<b>That <a href=\"http://shot.skatekrak.com/4ym6gsgGvc\">15 decks ollie</a>&#8230; How many tries did you need to land it?<br />\n</b>It took me first try!<br />\n<b>Damn.
