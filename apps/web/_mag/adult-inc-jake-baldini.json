I had little plastic skateboards from the 1970s around my house my whole life from my aunts and uncles and I was riding those as far as I can remember but I don&#8217;t remember when exactly I got my first real skateboard. I think it had completely taken over by the time I was 9 or 10.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3327\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3327\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3327\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/adult-JAKE-John-Shanahan.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Baldini.

What’s been your involvement in bringing the brand to life?<br />\n</strong></span>It’s still the very beginning. I was able to go along to the manufacturers warehouse and see the operation and be involved in deciding on shape and size, which was fun. It’s still so new&#8230; Anthony is open to a lot of different ideas and making it fun though so we will all be involved as it progresses.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Anthony told us you were especially vocal in wanting the company to be East Coast rooted. Why was that important to you? What do you think it is about the East Coast skate scene that makes it special?<br />\n</strong></span>Well it is rooted here, this is where we live and generally skate. It didn&#8217;t make sense to me to have the skateboards made in California or somewhere else by some people that are over there. Chapman has been doing it for a long time and the warehouse is located on Long Island so we can actually go there, communicate with the people who are doing it where we are doing it. Skateboarding here is just different, it’s been said a million times but there is a certain aesthetic, it&#8217;s obvious. There are a lot of skaters here doing cool things, making cool videos because they want to and there is nothing to be had in return as far as the industry goes because there isn&#8217;t really one on this side of the country. I don&#8217;t know if that makes it special but it’s definitely different.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3328\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3328\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3328\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/adult-Jake-Mac-Shafer.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Baldini.
