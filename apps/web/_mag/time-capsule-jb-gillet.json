Gillet?</strong></h3>\n<p>Back in the mid-&#8217;90s, if you were a skater from Europe trying to make it in skateboarding, it was a given that you had to head over to the US. Alongside Enrique Lorenzo, Daniel Lebron, Alfonso and Jesus Fernandez, Jean-Baptiste &#8220;J.B.&#8221; Gillet was among the first wave of European skaters that moved to California in search of smoother ground, year round summer weather and California&#8217;s legendary spots.</p>\n<p><em>J.B. in the New Deal Promo &#8220;Ninety Six&#8221;(1996).</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KyUNhSA5ZMs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3><strong>Learning English from listening to Tupac? </strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;Damn, that&#8217;s good shit.&#8221; &#8211; J.B. Gillet</strong></h3>\n<p>Originally from Lyon, France, J.B. first arrived in San Francisco in &#8217;96 in the final bust-free days of EMB and just as Pier 7 was starting to blow up. After learning English from listening to Tupac, plus a little help from the Pier 7 crew who doubled as English tutors, J.B. continued to pick up sponsors, stack footage and eventually moved down to Los Angeles where he became roomies with Enrique Lorenzo. From riding for New Deal, to Alien Workshop flow to a stint on World Industries and almost becoming a part of the Chocolate family, J.B. turned pro for Daewon Song&#8217;s Deca in 2000(that <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/iEIp9KLr4H/?modal=true\" target=\"_blank\">first pro model World Cup graphic</a> was fire!).</p>\n<p><em>J.B. in &#8220;Rodney vs Daewon: Round 2&#8243;(1999).

Courthouse, J.B.&#8217;s been straight killin&#8217; it for more than 20 years.</p>\n<p><em>J.B. in Cliche&#8217;s &#8220;Freedom Fries&#8221;(2004).</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUjRVGt9UtI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>Full circle</h3>\n<p>Now riding for Jeremie Daclin&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.clicheskate.com\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"st\"><em>Cliché</em></span></a> skateboards(now also part of the Dwindle family), J.B. has indeed come full circle. These few videos are just a tiny sampling of J.B.&#8217;s amazing skateboarding(you can see that he was way ahead of the times) and testament to his longevity. And yes, style really is everything.</p>\n<p><em>J.B.&#8217;s &#8220;Day in the life&#8221;(2012) in China.</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dlYNFBF6Eo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Thanks for the inspiration all these years, J.B., and for introducing a generation of skaters to French hip hop!!!
