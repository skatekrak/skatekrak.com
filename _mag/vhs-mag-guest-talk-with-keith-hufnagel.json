The name HUF should be more than familiar to you, and the man behind the brand, Keith Hufnagel is one of the most respected pro skateboarders from out of the East Coast in the past two decades. A stalwart on the Thunder and Spitfire program, this East Coast powerhouse and now West Coast transplant is part-owner of HUF, Keith&#8217;s career as a skateboarding business owner is just getting started with HUF&#8217;s more recent foray into the footwear game.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1501 aligncenter\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.31.03-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-01 at 6.31.03 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.31.03-PM.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.31.03-PM.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.31.03-PM.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.31.03-PM.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>From the early days of the HUF brand as a sneaker boutique in SF to their SoCal migration with a retail front on Fairfax, Keith has been instrumental in steering the brand through the vagaries of the skateboarding business cycle and making moves to enter the ultra-competitive footwear game. In this short little Guest Talk interview with Tokyo&#8217;s VHS MAG, Keith talks about coming up on the East Coast, getting sponsored by Thunder and Spitfire through Shrewgy (now of ACE trucks) , running HUF, the infamous plantlife socks, and his vision for how HUF fits into skateboarding. A worthwhile watch for a little behind the scenes at a skater owned brand built from the ground up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1503 aligncenter\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-7.18.55-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-01 at 7.18.55 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-7.18.55-PM.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-7.18.55-PM.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-7.18.55-PM.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-7.18.55-PM.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1500 aligncenter\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.30.29-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-01 at 6.30.29 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.30.29-PM.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.30.29-PM.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.30.29-PM.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.30.29-PM.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/128435400\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"[GUEST TALK] KEITH HUFNAGEL\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","author":"kev","categories":["interviews"],"tags":["fun-skateboards","huf","huf-footwear","keith-hufnagel","life-skateboards","real-skateboards","spitfire-wheels","thunder-trucks","vhs-mag"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.28.16-PM.png","width":1440,"height":900,"mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-6.28.16-PM.png"}],"video":""}
