Transcending language and cultural differences, if you skate, you can relate and are part of the same big skateboarding family. In this second installment of Youngblood, we talk to <a href=\"http://www.thekayostore.com/collections/dgk\" target=\"_blank\">DGK</a> Japan&#8217;s Shinya Masuda from South Osaka. I first met Shinya over 2 years ago, when he first came to Los Angeles on a short skate trip and I was trying to practice my really terrible Japanese. He was already blowing minds back then with an ill style and a ridiculous switch game. He&#8217;s only gotten better since and you can be sure that you&#8217;ll be seeing more of him in the future. Without further ado, I present to you Shinya Masuda. <span class=\"st\">がんばって</span> &#8211; HK<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1197 aligncenter\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_225/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-16.20.42.jpg\" alt=\"2015-03-07 16.20.42\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_225/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-16.20.42.jpg 225w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_768/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-16.20.42.jpg 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-16.20.42.jpg 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-16.20.42.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Krak: Your name and age?</h3>\n<p>Shinya: My name is Shinya Masuda, I&#8217;m 21 years old.</p>\n<h3>How do we pronounce your name right? Is there a correct pronounciation.</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s spelt S-H-I-N-Y-A, everyone can call me Shin-ya.</p>\n<h3>And your last name is Masuda?</h3>\n<p>Yes, Masuda.</p>\n<h3>Is there a meaning behind your name? What does it mean in Japanese?</h3>\n<p>The meaning is real. Like truth. Keep it real! (laughs)</p>\n<h3>Damn, that&#8217;s a sick name.</h3>\n<p>(laughs)</p>\n<h3>Where are you from in Japan?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m from Osaka, and I live on the South side of Osaka.</p>\n<h3>Is there a name for that part of the city?</h3>\n<p>City? The city is Izumi city. Yeah, represent Izumi!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Shinya cruising around Taipei, Taiwan.</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XugdJlBFcsM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s it like in Osaka? If you had to tell someone who&#8217;s never been there?</h3>\n<p>Ahhh, Osaka. Osaka is similar to Cali. People are friendly, and there&#8217;s a lot of good food. And the city is kind of small compared to Tokyo, smaller than Tokyo. So you can go anywhere by bullet train( also known as the Shinkansen). And then, there are some skate spots.</p>\n<h3>Is there a big skate scene? Are there a lot of skaters over there in Osaka?</h3>\n<p>Yeah, there are a lot of skaters, but not so many skateparks over there.</p>\n<h3>So you mainly skate street? No wonder you&#8217;re so good.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, everybody skates street. Everybody&#8217;s so good. And it&#8217;s underground.</p>\n<h3>What is Osaka known for? I know Glico(a Japanese foodstuff manufacturer) is from Osaka right? I grew up liking Pocky(a Japanese chocolate snack). What else is also from Osaka?</h3>\n<p>(laughs) Yeah, haha. Osaka is also famous for Takoyaki(a Japanese wheat based snack), Okonomiyaki(a Japanese savory pancake), they&#8217;re both from Osaka.</p>\n<h3>Oh that&#8217;s so sick! I didn&#8217;t even realize that.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, and it&#8217;s best in Osaka, better than anywhere else.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Nose manny at Courthouse.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1200 aligncenter\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-18.18.02.jpg\" alt=\"2015-03-07 18.18.02\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-18.18.02.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-18.18.02.jpg 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-18.18.02.jpg 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/2015-03-07-18.18.02.jpg 1824w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Coming back to skateboarding, when did you start skating?</h3>\n<p>I started to skate when I was 11 or 12.</p>\n<h3>What was your first setup like?</h3>\n<p>First setup was a Flip board, maybe Venture trucks. Wheels I don&#8217;t remember, maybe Spitfire.</p>\n<h3>So you&#8217;ve been skating Ventures forever basically?</h3>\n<p>Yeah, and the first shoes I bought was Savier.</p>\n<h3>Savier? Oh man, that&#8217;s OG dude. Damn!! You should have kept those! Did you know which model you got? Did you get the Brian Andersons or something?</h3>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t remember, but they were Savier.</p>\n<h3>So you were just saying that there aren&#8217;t too many skateparks in your hometown? Is there one you like to go to when you&#8217;re back in Osaka?</h3>\n<p>Skateparks? No, I don&#8217;t go skateparks, I go to this big public space, where skaters have put a box and some rails. The spots I skate always change, but my favorite skate spot is the Komyo Ike Station.</p>\n<h3>Komyo Ike Station? I need to go look this spot up at some point. What&#8217;s your favorite skateshop in Osaka? Where do I go if I needed to pick up some stuff?</h3>\n<p>Skateshop?

Japanese pros?</h3>\n<p>One of the most famous Japanese pros is Ura Tomokazu.</p>\n<h3>I need to look him up. Favorite skatespot in Los Angeles?</h3>\n<p>In LA? Of course Stoner and Courthouse. And downtown LA.</p>\n<h3>We should skate downtown more! Who do you like skating with most when you&#8217;re back in Osaka?</h3>\n<p>In Osaka? All my homies in South Osaka. Yeah yeah.

Tokyo is pretty nice.</p>\n<h3>I hear it&#8217;s really hard to skate there because it&#8217;s so crowded so you have to go out at night to street skate?</h3>\n<p>Yeah, especially street skating.

Like switch makes me try new things more than regular. It&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s my favorite stance.</p>\n<h3>Must be something in the water in Japan, the great food, and the Sashimi that is helping with your switch pop.

What Japanese hip hop do you recommend we check out?</h3>\n<p>I recommend Kan, Kohh, and Evis Beats. He makes some chill songs.</p>\n<h3>I guess we only hear of the more mainstream names like Zeebra, DABO, Tokona-X?</h3>\n<p>Yeah, DABO! Tokona-X has passed away but I like him. I recommend Tokona-X too. And I recommend Basi, he represents South Osaka.</p>\n<h3>I need to go check all that out, thanks for the recommendations. The skate scene in Japan is still so closely linked with hip hop.</h3>\n<p>Yeah, skate scene and hip hop are always connected in Japan.</p>\n<h3>Are you filming for a video right now?</h3>\n<p>I was filming for the Expressions video, a local Osaka company.</p>\n<h3>The &#8220;Ride Pride&#8221; video?</h3>\n<p>Yeah, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zphk-5X1mQw\" target=\"_blank\">Ride Pride video</a>.
