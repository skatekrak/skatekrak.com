Some of the old rats even argue that “it was considered more punk/hardcore to not use rails, for example none of the Alva guys had them”. The rails went out of fashion in the early 90’s and from there we haven&#8217;t really experienced any comeback… until now.</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2804\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2804\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2804\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/enjoi-tummy-stick-rails.jpg\" alt=\"enjoi Tummy Stick Rails\" width=\"680\" height=\"205\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/enjoi-tummy-stick-rails.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/enjoi-tummy-stick-rails.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">enjoi Tummy Stick Rails</p></div>\n<p><em>There are basically two main reasons for using rails: it feels way better for your board slides (and we can tell these ones slide very well) and it’s nice for grabs. You have to keep in mind the rationale behind them: back in the days, skateboarders were mostly sliding some concrete coping (and you can imagine that pool coping was not as smooth as the angle iron and waxed granite curbs we have nowadays).</em></p>\n<p><em>But try for yourself. Put the rails on and everything will feel slick. And like <a href=\"https://enjoico.com/louiebarletta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Louie Barletta</a> told us himself in one of our discussions, “we here at enjoi are all about fun, fun, fun!! <a href=\"https://enjoico.com/caswellberry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caswell</a> knows there&#8217;s nothing more fun than slappin&#8217; on a set of <a href=\"https://thankyousupply.com/collections/accessories/products/enj-tummy-sticks-rails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enjoi tummy sticks</a> rails and getting down with some long slick board slides!”</em></p>\n<p><em>We quickly caught up with enjoi rider <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/deeddz/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Didrik Gallaso</a> to understand why he seems to be so in love with his board rails.
