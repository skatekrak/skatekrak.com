I&#8217;m born and bred from NJ and currently tearing up South Brunswick, Central Jersey.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>When did you start skateboarding?</strong></span><br />\nI started skating when I was 9. My neighbor had a Blind board and a rail. I liked the reaper and I loved the newly found rush.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Can you tell us how you even thought about launching a blanket company?</strong></span><br />\nAfter the military I worked for a home decor company and learned plenty about the industry. I noticed that there were no dope designed blankets out there and what better than to make one geared toward the thrashers of the world. That’s how <a href=\"https://www.lazyshift.com/product-page/skate-dreams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skate Dreams</a> came to be.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3029\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3029\" class=\"wp-image-3029\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-skate-dreams.jpg\" alt=\"Lazy Shift Skate Dreams\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-skate-dreams.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-skate-dreams.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-3029\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Skate Dreams blanket</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>What&#8217;s the concept behind Lazy Shift in fact? Because now on your website we could find tons of reviews as well?</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.lazyshift.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LAZY SHIFTs</a> entire mindset is to chill. Everyday we have to get up and go be apart of society. Busting our ass&#8217;s to stay alive. Well when we’re done doing what we must it’s time to clock out of the work shift and back into the Lazy Shift. Lazy Shift can be whatever you want it to be, anything that helps you relax. We started doing <a href=\"https://www.lazyshift.com/the-shift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews</a> to just give the Shifters some ideas of what to check out when they are clocked in. Books, Movies, Video games, concerts, tattoo parlors, dope eateries. Everything is chill when you’re down with the Shift.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Do you have other writers/reviewers too?</strong></span><br />\nI would say I contribute about 25% of the reviews. We have shift reviewers all over the world and encourage everyone who wants to do a little creative writing to shoot us an email and let us know what’s dope.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3028\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3028\" class=\"wp-image-3028\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-rob-werner.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Werner at Love Park\" width=\"500\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-rob-werner.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-rob-werner.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-3028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rob Werner at Love Park</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>What&#8217;s the plan now?</strong></span><br />\nThe plan now is to just keep growing. Make dope blankets, keep the people chilling and look into more cool stuff to produce. We are working on some really awesome pyjama bottoms that can be worn in the house or out. Honestly though just living the Lazy Shift is what makes me happy and I want to continue to do that and keep recruiting the homies of the world to do the same.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3027\" style=\"width: 340px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3027\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3027\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-mark-rags.jpg\" alt=\"Lazy Shift Mark Rags\" width=\"330\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-mark-rags.jpg 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_189/mag/uploads/lazy-shift-mark-rags.jpg 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-3027\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mark Rags</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Who did the graphic on the skate dreams blanket we included in the mix?</strong></span><br />\nThe skate Dreams graphic was done by a very talented homie out in Europe – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jh_illustration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jamie Hodgson</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Would you have any piece of advice for the peeps who&#8217;re reading you now and would hesitate to launch their own company?</strong></span><br />\nNever hesitate but make a plan. Look that plan over and throw it out and write another one. Have fun and create. They say that a skater is one of the best entrepreneurs in the world and they don&#8217;t even know it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>What could we wish you for 2017?</strong></span><br />\nHealth, happiness and plenty of time ripping these streets.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Any shout-outs?</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jh_illustration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@Jh_illustration</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/baseborn_dave/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@baseborn_dave</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/classicskateshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@classicskateshop</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alliknowisgoon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@alliknowisgoon</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/primeskateshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@primeskateshop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/insta_gramed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@insta_gramed</a> and of course KRAK!</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><strong>This interview was originally featured in the printed KrakMag issue 12 that shipped with the Holy Mix <a href=\"https://krakbox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KrakBox</a>.
