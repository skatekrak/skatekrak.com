Transcending language and cultural differences, if you skate, you can relate and are part of the same skateboarding family. And you know that skateboarding has truly become global when you meet skateboarders who travel halfway around the world to Los Angeles California, just so that they can skate Stoner Plaza and the Courthouse and the multitude of legendary SoCal spots(and also maybe meet some of their favorite pros along the way). <a href=\"http://www.ifoskateboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IFO Skateboard&#8217;s</a> Satoshi Ikeda is just one such individual who made the trek from Japan to Los Angeles, and we were fortunate enough to get to spend a couple of months skating and hanging out with him. An immensely talented skateboarder, super down to earth, friendly and humble, we sat down with Ikeda-san for a Youngblood interview at LAX before he caught his flight back to Japan. You can check out Satoshi&#8217;s sick Courthouse line in the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\">Krak app</a> and also in <a href=\"http://mag.skatekrak.com/15-kraked/\" target=\"_blank\">Kraked! #15</a>. You&#8217;ll definitely be seeing more of him in the future. Satoshi-san, <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">がんばって</span>(Ganbatte)!!! &#8211; HK<br />\n</em></p>\n<h3>Okay, let&#8217;s start off with the basics. What&#8217;s your full name?</h3>\n<p>Satoshi Ikeda, Ikeda is my family(last) name.</p>\n<h3>Satoshi, how do we correctly say your first name? Am I even saying it right?</h3>\n<p>You can pronounce it as Satoshi or Satosh. Both are good.</p>\n<h3>How old are you?</h3>\n<p>I am 19 years old.</p>\n<h3>Where are you from in Japan, exactly?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m from Kumamoto City which is in the southern part of the island of Kyushu.</p>\n<h3>What is Kumamoto City like?</h3>\n<p>Kumamoto is a small city, the summers are super hot and humid, and the winters are super cold.</p>\n<h3>You have a really crazy bag of tricks, late flips, nollie inward heels, and more. When did you start skating?</h3>\n<p>Thank you, I started skating 4 years ago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-963 alignright\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_200/mag/uploads/Ikeda-Satoshi-backtail-Santa-Monica.png\" alt=\"Ikeda Satoshi backtail Santa Monica\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_200/mag/uploads/Ikeda-Satoshi-backtail-Santa-Monica.png 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Ikeda-Satoshi-backtail-Santa-Monica.png 399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Backtail at dusk, Santa Monica, 2015. </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/ryuta1990_/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryuta Hironaga</a></em></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Holy crap.

Seriously.</h3>\n<p>(laughs)</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s your favorite skatespot/skatepark in your hometown?</h3>\n<p>I really like Karashima Park and Shirakawa Park.

The Courthouse ledges are so good, and Stoner Plaza is super fun to skate. Plus, the Stoner Locals are really friendly.</p>\n<h3>Yeah, I love Stoner Plaza too. I know you have a badass flatground game, but what do you like skating most? Ledges? Stairs? Rails?</h3>\n<p>I like skating ledges and stairs.</p>\n<p><em>Satoshi Ikeda Chill Skate.</em></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttthchtv9sk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3>Who do you normally skate with back in Japan? How about out here in Los Angeles?</h3>\n<p>Back in Japan, I usually skate with my Kumamoto homies Koichiro and Wataru.

Why did you come to Los Angeles?</h3>\n<p>I came here to study at a language school and to skateboard.</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re a really long way from Japan! Did you end up skating Stoner Plaza or Courthouse every day?</h3>\n<p>(laughs) Almost every day. Haha.</p>\n<h3>No wonder I see you at either spot almost every time I&#8217;m there.  That&#8217;s a lot of skating man! We have it so good, we almost take Stoner Plaza and Courthouse for granted.
