To top it all off, she recently had five of her photos published in Thrasher Magazine. It’s fair to say that Zorah is leading the way for female photographers in the skate industry.</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>PHOTOGRAPHY RUNS IN YOUR FAMILY; HOW MUCH DID THIS INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION TO PICK UP A CAMERA? DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE STANDARDS TO LIVE UP TO BECAUSE OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY?</strong></span></p>\n<p>My parents were always open minded and supportive of whatever I wanted to pursue. They were even there cheering me on when I had my heart set on soccer or taekwondo, even though my interest usually didn&#8217;t last long. I so many fond memories from my childhood of days spent on photoshoots or in the studio watching my mom paint.</p>\n<p>I remember my family telling me that a career in the arts would be difficult and often unreliable but the most rewarding as long as your heart remains in your craft. I don&#8217;t feel like they have placed any standards on me other than to be the best person I can be and treat others with kindness, I&#8217;m so thankful for their love and support.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>WHO IS YOUR FAVOURITE SKATER TO SHOOT?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The list is too long to pick a favorite but recently I have been going out shooting with Dave Mull and The Worble crew, it’s always a good time! I love those dudes. Jenn Soto and I have an amazing skater/photographer relationship as well. There’s never any pressure, we just hype each other up!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3593\" style=\"width: 379px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah02.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3593\" class=\"wp-image-3593 size-full\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah02.jpg 369w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_150/mag/uploads/zorah02.jpg 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/zorah02.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vanessa Torres</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>YOU SHOOT A LOT OF STREET PHOTOS BUT YOU’VE ALSO SHOT SOME BIG EVENTS LIKE STREET LEAGUE. WHICH DO YOU PREFER AND WHY?</strong></span></p>\n<p>Creatively, I prefer shooting in the streets but contests challenge me in other ways! When I’m out street skating, it’s often just me and the skater and we have time to collaborate and plan how we want the photo to look. With contests, everyone is skating at the same time, it’s almost like a marathon to capture all of the tricks happening around you at once. I love it though!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>YOU’VE BEEN SHOOTING SKATE PHOTOS FOR A WHILE, BUT YOU GOT YOUR BIG BREAK THROUGH MAHFIA.TV. HOW DID THIS CONNECTION COME ABOUT AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES DID IT PRESENT?</strong></span></p>\n<p>I emailed Kim Woozy, the creator of Mahfia, about summer internships back when I was going to college in Maryland. I actually forgot that I emailed her when I received a response about 2 months later. She told me that she checked out my website and really liked my photos. We ended up talking on the phone for 45 minutes and she invited me to shoot X Games on that same call. I wouldn’t be where I am today without Kim Woozy and Mimi Knoop’s support. The thank you list is a long one, there are so many incredible men and women in the skateboarding community that have supported me over the past year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3594\" style=\"width: 379px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah03.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3594\" class=\"wp-image-3594 size-full\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah03.jpg 369w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_150/mag/uploads/zorah03.jpg 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/zorah03.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3594\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stella &amp; Andrew Reynolds</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>DESCRIBE YOUR PERFECT DAY IN LA WHEN YOU&#8217;RE NOT SHOOTING PHOTOS</strong></span></p>\n<p>Sleep in a little longer than usual, make a nice breakfast , and spend the day reading on the beach somewhere far from the city.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>WHAT WOULD BE YOUR DREAM PHOTOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT? WHO, WHAT, WHERE AND WHEN?</strong></span></p>\n<p>I would love to spend a year traveling around the world with a skate team/brand, preferably with all of the girls! My fantasy though is being a personal photographer for Ru Paul or Ellen Degeneres (I&#8217;m laughing to myself as I read this).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3595\" style=\"width: 379px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah04.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3595\" class=\"wp-image-3595 size-full\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah04.jpg 369w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_150/mag/uploads/zorah04.jpg 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/zorah04.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nora Vasconcellos</p></div>\n","author":"simon","categories":["interviews"],"tags":["interview","photography","womens-skateboarding"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"zorah01.jpg","width":585,"height":388,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/zorah01.jpg"}],"video":""}
