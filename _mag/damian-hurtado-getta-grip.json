I met up with Damian at Berlin Bistro in Long Beach, ordered some beers and got chatting. Enjoy. k.Â </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Icelandic Beer. Never tried that one before.<br />\n</strong></span>Oh youâ€™re gonna love it man. Itâ€™s nice and smooth you know.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Cheers!!</span></strong><br />\nCheers!!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>So, you grew up in Long Beach?<br />\n</strong></span>Kind of yeah. Like 10-20 minutes away from here.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Oh so thatâ€™s pretty much home right?</strong></span><br />\nKind of yeah. I also lived in Ohio. That was pretty cool, I lives in Columbus, OH, Dayton, like 2 years, that was not too bad.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>For school? Or did you follow your parents?<br />\n</strong></span>My Aunt took care of me for a little bit, and my little sister. Itâ€™s so nice out there. It was like a retirement scene. All the kids there really hated me. I was so loud and obnoxious. It was funny though.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>What&#8217;s the story with this tattoo?</strong></span><br />\nYeah. I got that and then started the company. I drew it out, made it and I was so inspired I was like â€˜letâ€™s do itâ€™. I got it tattooed and then started the company.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Haha same for me. I got that one, it was the logo of my first company. Funny in fact you think about Jamie getting his company&#8217;s logos tattooed as well â€” when youâ€™re really passionate about something itâ€™s part of you, your skin.<br />\n</strong></span>All my homies thought I was stupid. haha! There were like â€˜hey but youâ€™re not doing anythingâ€™ but I was like â€˜gimme some timeâ€™.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Is it your first one?<br />\n</strong></span>No second one. This is my first one, I did it myself. I did it when I was 16.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Yourself? Wow! That takes courage.</strong></span><br />\nHaha I was shaking tho. But it came out good at the end.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Was it hard to draw it upside down?</strong></span><br />\nKinda. I just made the stencil and then put it out and I just had to follow somehow. It actually inspired me to draw. Itâ€™s like poetry itâ€™s awesome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>And then you got all the other ones.</strong></span><br />\nMost of them are crap though. I&#8217;ve got some of my leg too. Always dumb.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Funny when you start it becomes like a drug. Once you got one, you already have 15 different ideas in your head for the next ones.</strong></span><br />\nYeah I got plenty. I wanna have more. This one is like random chick. Cool stuff. But that part hurt so bad!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Did you tattoo some friends too?</strong></span><br />\nOh yeah I tattooed a lot. Iâ€™ve been tattooing a little bit lately but not too much, just stencil art. So Iâ€™m doing that and I work at the Pizzeria down the street. Itâ€™s part-time, for fun.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2860\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2860\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2860\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-2.jpg\" alt=\"Getta Grip\" width=\"680\" height=\"1039\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-2.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_196/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-2.jpg 196w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_670/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-2.jpg 670w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damian Hurtado.

So Iâ€™m working there like 30 hours a week and then just straight painting.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>So thatâ€™s how you balance the day basically?</strong></span><br />\nYeah.

So many fun things to do.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Okay and that park isnâ€™t far from here right?<br />\n</strong></span>5min. Always cool folks there. Everyone in Long Beach is very cool. I wanna stay here.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Really? I donâ€™t know it at all in fact. Itâ€™s my second time here. Oh you wanna know one funny thing: my first time here was to meet <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mikendo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mikendo</a> and we met right here, in the same coffee shop haha!<br />\n</strong></span>Oh yeah he lives down the street.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>We were sitting on the terrace and just saw Geoff Rowley across the street.<br />\n</strong></span>Yeah all the pro skaters are here in Long Beach.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Ok so you love LB?<br />\n</strong></span>Oh dude Iâ€™m in love with Long Beach, so mellow, nice people, dog-friendly.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>You didnâ€™t even need to go outside of the neighborhood right?<br />\n</strong></span>You donâ€™t need a car here. Just use a bike or your skateboard. But still I have a car haha! I needed one. I have a shitty Volvo.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Mikendo told me the same thing like here you just need a bike.<br />\n</span></strong>Well yeah I just use my car twice a week you know. Not too much. So itâ€™s only to go outside. But today is like so hot, Iâ€™m not biking today, Iâ€™ll use the car.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Haha thatâ€™s true. You know thatâ€™s the type of weather where I always remind myself â€˜hey ride slowâ€™ but itâ€™s super hard in fact to go slow when you ride a bike because you wanna go fast. But right nowâ€¦ arrgh itâ€™s too hot.<br />\n</strong></span>Well it feels like in NYC right now. You know in NYC it could be like 105. Too hot.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2863\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-krak.jpg\" alt=\"Getta Grip x Krak\" width=\"680\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-krak.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/getta-grip-krak.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Where did you get the inspiration for the Krak collab drawing?<br />\n</strong></span>I first drew the kraken, then just put the box somewhere inside. Itâ€™s called preppy red; the paintbox.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>The black will be hard to cut though. 30 layers.<br />\n</strong></span>I called the Pizzeria like â€˜hey Iâ€™ll just work 2 days a weekâ€™ for while cause I have to draw and cut haha!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Do you speak Italian?<br />\n</strong></span>A little bit. My aunt speaks Italian so when we go over there to eat, she always speaks Italian.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Have you been to Europe already?<br />\n</strong></span>Nope. Iâ€™ll go next year. To Napoli, where my family comes from initially, and then Iâ€™ll spend some time around the rest of Europe.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Whatâ€™s next with Getta Grip?<br />\n</strong></span>Oh I gotta a whole new line coming up. I have like a big Mohamed Ali stencil.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Ok so youâ€™re paying tribute each time a cool dude passes away?</strong></span><br />\nWell yeah. I wanted to do a Mohamed Ali one like 2 years ago and just never did. And now I was like â€˜argh heâ€™s gone I have to do it nowâ€™. No one has done it yet so Iâ€™m gonna do it. And then Iâ€™m gonna do my little sister&#8217;s art. Pretty sick. I got a lot of things actually. Oh I got one thing based on a Thrasher logo, you know the one with the flame. So doing that and a couple thing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Okay so itâ€™s a lot about new designs mainly?<br />\n</strong></span>Yeah.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2857\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-3.jpg\" alt=\"Getta Grip\" width=\"680\" height=\"937\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-3.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_218/mag/uploads/getta-grip-3.jpg 218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>So your sister draws as well? Was it like a family thing? Did your parents used to draw too?<br />\n</strong></span>No. It just started haha!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>[ordered another round] How did you start skateboarding?<br />\n</strong></span>I started when I was very little, barely walking. I was like 3. And then skated til I was 6. And due to my family religion, they were like â€˜you canâ€™t use these wheels anymoreâ€™. Yeah you canâ€™t do skateboarding, bikingâ€¦ and any other shit. So Iâ€™m like â€˜youâ€™re kidding meâ€™ and they were like â€˜no, noâ€™. So they took my skateboard. So I was just skating at my friends house and when I go back home, they yelled at me like â€˜we told you not to skateboardâ€™ so I was fucked and I stopped skating. At least until I was about 12. I fucking loved skateboarding so I bought one and used it until my mom found it &amp; threw it away and I was screwed. But still from 12 til now I always have my skateboard. I would land a kick flip down 12 stairs and get home and hide my skateboard.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Wow first time I hear a story like this. But why?<br />\n</strong></span>This was the religion I donâ€™t know. They found that religion and they were â€˜no wheelsâ€™. They wanted to believe in it, so I donâ€™t know, I had to listen to them too as their child. I always loved skateboarding though. You know at 16 I broke my shoulder and they were like â€˜you see we told youâ€™ but for me this was part of the game. And now Iâ€™m older and I popped it out a while ago and theyâ€™re still like â€˜you see I told youâ€™ but dude I donâ€™t hide it anymore. I&#8217;ve got my own apartment.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2856\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-2.jpg\" alt=\"Getta Grip\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-2.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/getta-grip-2.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>You wanna keep your design on griptape or at some point you wanna put them on t-shirts or something else?<br />\n</strong></span>I donâ€™t know. Griptape for now. My roommate wants to start a headwear company. I said, â€˜I&#8217;ll help you outâ€™, Iâ€™ve so many ideas and sketchbooks.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Why griptape in the first place?<br />\n</strong></span>It started when I went to LA. I was about 15 and I drove to LA with some friends and I looked at buildings and there was some stencil art and I thought it was cool. I didn&#8217;t know anything about stencil art. I started to try, cutting and spraying everything at school; t-shirts anything. I wanted to put it on my skateboard but I didnâ€™t want to fuck my deck so I put it on my griptape and then I called it something stupid like Unicorn Grip and 4 other different names. By high school I was so hyped so I got it tattooed and then started Getta Grip.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Are you stoked when you go to a park and see your griptape?<br />\n</strong></span>Oh yeah. Here in Long Beach a lot of kids have them but last time I was in NYC, and I saw someone with it and I was psyched!</p>\n<p><em>The discussion went on and on for at least an hour. We were very proud to support Damian him with Getta Grip. He asked us at the end if our US warehouse was in Portland, OR because he wanted to drive there to deliver the griptape. And he did; with his dog of course.</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2861\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2861\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2861\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-3.jpg\" alt=\"Getta Grip\" width=\"680\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-3.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/getta-grip-damian-3.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Damian and his dog in Portland</p></div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><strong>These interviews were originally featured in the printed KrakMag issues 6 &amp; 9.
