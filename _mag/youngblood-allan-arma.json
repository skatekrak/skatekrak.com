For those of you who have been with us since the beginning you can even remember a quick Q&amp;A we made back in the day (in the KM#3 to be precise). <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allanarma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allan</a> has evolved since that date and progressed for sure. We stayed in touch and decided to jump on a phone call to catch up. Here’s his story. k.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>K: Yo Allan, do you hear me well? Are you happy with the pictures you showed me the other day?</strong></span><br />\nYep it’s perfect. These ones are interesting but we’re still shooting. I’d like to add a couple more.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Ok cool. Look forward to it. Could you introduce yourself briefly?</strong></span><br />\nI live in Guadeloupe. There is basically nowhere to skate here, no skate shop and no skatepark so we have to build everything ourselves. That’s how we ended making our own DIY park.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2836\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2836\" class=\"wp-image-2836 size-full\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Arma\" width=\"680\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-portrait.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_200/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-portrait.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Allan Arma. Photo: Hypolite Champion</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Wow ok. Tell us first how you started to skate.</strong></span><br />\nI was just in front of my home and there was a skater who rolled everyday across the street. His name was Christophe and he started to show me how to skate, he taught me. That’s how I started. He’s now in Bordeaux.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>And what about your first skateboard?</strong></span><br />\nI bought one in a Decathlon store. Then I got a deck from some grown-ups and that’s how I started to learn my first tricks like flips. Then my mum offered me a new board for Christmas, like a whole new set up you know, and from there I skated every day.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>You told me there isn’t any skate shop on the island so tell me: where does your gear come from?</strong></span><br />\nIt comes from an online shop that ships here. We need more boards, a better quality and so on so fortunately there are these online shops. But the good news for me now is: I don’t need that much equipment anymore thanks to my sponsors haha!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Haha I see. But what about the other skateboarders?</strong></span><br />\nOne of my sponsors, he lives in France but he comes sometimes here in Guadeloupe and he drops off some stuff each time. This way it’s even better for the locals. If they want a board or anything they can come to me and I sell it to them. I try to help the best I can, you know.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The guy from Pure, is he from there?</span></strong><br />\nHe used to live here. During his childhood he was in France. He came here and then studied here. He’s been to Bordeaux for holidays but he loved it and found a job so then he stayed there.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Which means he already used to skate before arriving in Guadeloupe, right?</strong></span><br />\nMaybe a little but he really started once he arrived here.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>As soon as someone starts to skate, do you all know it?</strong></span><br />\nWe all know each other that’s true. And as soon as someone new arrives in town we help him. If he comes from France he already knows us by name at least so he can call and we all go to skate together.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2837\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2837\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2837\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-switch-heel.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Arma, switch heel.

Photo: Hypolite Champion</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Why don’t you launch your own skateshop?</strong></span><br />\nHmm there isn’t enough skateboarders I think. It’s true that skateboarding is expanding here but we’re not at a point yet where we could open a dedicated shop. The scene isn’t big enough.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Got it. Hey did you celebrate your birthday just few days ago?</strong></span><br />\nYep it was on March 20th.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Happy birthday man! How old are you by the way?</strong></span><br />\n16.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Who are your sponsors?</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.pure-worldwide.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pure</a>. I&#8217;ve been part of the team for a while, like 2 years. I was actually their first rider on the team.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Where do they come from?</strong></span><br />\nThe brand is from France but the owner is from here in Guadeloupe.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Where does he live now?</strong></span><br />\nHe lives in Nice. He’s in Guadeloupe nowadays because we’re filming a video. He&#8217;s already shot in Marseille, Paris and now in Guadeloupe. Next month he’ll film in LA.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Will you travel with them?</strong></span><br />\nNope, I’ll just shoot in Paris and Guadeloupe.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2831\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2831\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2831\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-board-slide-eglise-moule-allan.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Arma, boardslide.

Photo: Hypolite Champion</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>When do you plan to go in Paris?</strong></span><br />\nNext summer. Then my second sponsor is <a href=\"http://trueloveskate.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">True Love</a>, from Barbados, an island right next to us. It’s a young brand and we share the same spirit. They have a skate shop there and a skatepark as well but it’s a DIY too. But I have to admit theirs is better than ours haha!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Haha ok! Pure is a clothing brand. What’s True Love about?</strong></span><br />\nThey’re making boards. I’m also on the Converse flow team.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Nice.</strong></span><br />\nYeah it helps me a lot because shoes are very expensive and you always need new pairs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Which model do you skate?</strong></span><br />\nOne Star.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Are you one of the few sponsored skateboarders around?</strong></span><br />\nRight now I think I’m the only one.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>If you’re 16 I guess you’re still in high school?</strong></span><br />\nYep. I skate because I’m in love with it but I wanna study after high school.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>I think you’ll have to move out right?</strong></span><br />\nI won’t stay here. I’ll go either in London or in France.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>London? Why London?</strong></span><br />\nDon’t know. I just like how they live there.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Haha is it about the skate videos we see from there?</strong></span><br />\nHaha of course but I’ve also been there, like 2 weeks to visit, and I like it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2835\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2835\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2835\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-ollie.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Arma, ollie.

Photo: Victor Fromageot</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>And do you know Paris already?</strong></span><br />\nYep I’ve been there few times so I start to know it a little bit.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Have you already been to Lyon, or Bordeaux?</strong></span><br />\nNope, not yet. Oh sorry, I have to hang up because I’m thumbing a ride. Could I call you back in few minutes?</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Sure.</strong></span><br />\n&#8212;-<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>So where are you now?</strong></span><br />\nI’m in a party, I shared the ride with a homie.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Do you always thumb a ride or what?</strong></span><br />\nYeah buses are way too long and they’re too expensive as well.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>What about biking?</strong></span><br />\nWhy not but we were too far from our party. It only lasted 40minutes by car you know. It takes like 1h30min by bus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Are people nice most of the time? Like do they stop pretty quickly?</strong></span><br />\nIt depends but this time they stopped super quick because it rained I think.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Lucky you. I remember in Lyon, we could wait for an hour sometimes and no one was taking us for a ride…</strong></span><br />\nReally? At least in Lyon you have a lot more public transport.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tell me where are you with your own brand: Palm’s.</strong></span><br />\nHell yes. We’re selling our second collection already.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Nice. Tell us your story. What is it about?</strong></span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.palmshardware.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Palm’s Wheels</a>. We’re making wheels. But we haven&#8217;t started to sell the wheels yet. We’re selling t-shirts so far to make money to make the right wheels.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>How big is the team?</strong></span><br />\nThere are 3 of us. All under 18 haha!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2834\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2834\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2834\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-FS-Smith-2.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Arma, f/s smith.

Photo: Hypolite Champion</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Who’s making the design?</strong></span><br />\nAll of us. We don’t really have roles &amp; tasks you know. We’re all making a bit of everything.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Why wheels?</strong></span><br />\nIt’s mainly due to my sponsors. Otherwise I should have left one of them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>So right now you’re selling your tees.</strong></span><br />\nYep and we’re working on a website as well to sell them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Where are they made?</strong></span><br />\nThey&#8217;re made and designed here in Guadeloupe. We’re 100% local!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Congrats. Launching your own brand at 15, that’s quite a performance.</strong></span><br />\nHaha that’s cool, thank you. We&#8217;ve started to market the brand in Guadeloupe but when I’ll be in France I’ll bring some stuff with me in order to spread our name.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tell me a little bit more about your DIY park. Who’s managing the spot? What’s inside?</strong></span><br />\nAt the beginning it should have been the multimedia library but there wasn’t money to finish it. So we started to clean the space and create our own obstacles and… voila. We’re here for a little while now, like 3 years, and every skateboarder comes here sometimes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>And no one kicked you out already?</strong></span><br />\nNope, because if they kicked us out, they’d need to find another spot for us. And because there isn’t a lot of money they prefer to keep us here. And because we don’t mess things up they’re happy and they gave us the permission.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>How big is it?</strong></span><br />\nIt’s pretty big. I’ll send you one pic for sure. There is one floor. Downstairs is the street space and we’d like to create a ramp upstairs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2832\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2832\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2832\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-DIY.jpg\" alt=\"Guadeloupe DIY\" width=\"680\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-DIY.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-DIY.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2832\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Guadeloupe DIY</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>You have floors! Wow it means they’ve already built something, no?</strong></span><br />\nYeah it was almost done but they stopped at some point.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Do you only have that one spot so far or you already plan to create more of them?</strong></span><br />\nWe prefer to focus on that one for the moment and make it really good. And we hope it gives ideas to the mayor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Have you already talked to him?</strong></span><br />\nHe comes to see us pretty often honestly. But we lack money for sure.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>One day you’ll have so much money with Palm’s that you’ll be able to create your own one haha!</strong></span><br />\nHaha!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Is the DIY open 24/7 and free for all?</strong></span><br />\nWe put a padlock on but every skateboarder can open it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Which means you can come all night long?</strong></span><br />\nYep. Last time for instance, at Easter time we came here and set up a camp. We also have the beach behind.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Wow. So at the end of your session you all go to swim?</strong></span><br />\nThat’s our ritual yep. There are definitely some advantages.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Have you already organized a contest or anything?</strong></span><br />\nWe organize them ourselves but just for fun. Some local brands are involved too in order to give some goodies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2833\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2833\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2833\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Allan-Arma-flipback.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Arma, backside flip.
