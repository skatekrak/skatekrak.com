This is something I need to fix sometime soon. Still, I have to say, this country holds a really special spot in my mind. To be honest skateboarding wasn’t even the first reason why. As a teenager I was also a fan of video-games and manga; 2 things deeply rooted in Japan. So it’s no surprise that the culture resonated with me.</em></p>\n<p><em>Then I remember the first time I saw some skateboarding happening there and I was like ‘oh shit that looks so cool I’ve got to go there’. That was in my very first skate DVD ‘<a href=\"http://www.skatevideosite.com/skatevideos/es-menikmati/watch/3500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Menikmati</a>’. In the bonus section they put their Japan tour and I watched it over and over again. The vibe and all the spots seemed perfect. We could tell already that Japan has a totally different view on the world and skateboarding.</em></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2915\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/evisen-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/evisen-1.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/evisen-1.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></p>\n<p><em>This has definitely been proven true over the years and it is with a lot of pride and happiness that we introduce you now the mastermind behind <a href=\"http://evisenskateboards.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Evisen Skateboards</a>: Katsumi Minami; who started Evisen in Tokyo to support his local skate community.</em></p>\n<p><em>I remember a while ago reading a quick interview with Katsumi and something really struck me. When he was asked ‘besides skating, what other interests do you enjoy doing?’ he replied ‘None’. Period. A few years later, here we are in 2016 and the only thing that comes to mind right now is: hats off Minami-san! And long live Evisen and the whole Tokyo skate community. Look forward to skating with you. -k</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2917\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2917\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2917\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/evisen-3.jpg\" alt=\"Katsumi Minami, wallie to boardslide\" width=\"680\" height=\"1022\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/evisen-3.jpg 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_200/mag/uploads/evisen-3.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2917\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Katsumi Minami, wallie to boardslide.
