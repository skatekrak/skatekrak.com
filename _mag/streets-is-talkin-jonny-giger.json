WTH.</h3>\n<p>With the level of skateboarding getting pretty damn ridiculous these days, you&#8217;d think we would have seen it all in terms of progression, but evolution always has a way of surprising us and biting us in the ass. You probably remember Switzerland&#8217;s Jonny Giger as Joe #10 from <a href=\"http://theberrics.com/battle-at-the-berrics-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Battle at the Berrics 7</a>. He&#8217;s the Joe with the insane bag of tricks, including nollie and switch inward heel reverts and of course a crazy halfcab backfoot flip. You know what? Tre double flips are probably his warm up trick. Bet you didn&#8217;t know that he also throws it down hard in the streets right?</p>\n<p><a href=\"bit.ly/skatekrak\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-938 alignright\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Jonny-Giger.png\" alt=\"Jonny Giger\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Jonny-Giger.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/Jonny-Giger.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/Jonny-Giger.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Jonny-Giger.png 1093w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Well, alongside all his recent amazing flatground footage(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO5KFu8Lvec\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgz9FDVL72Y\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), Jonny&#8217;s also been busy stacking street clips and has just released his 2015 street part. This part is totally insane and we guarantee you&#8217;ll have to watch it at least twice. How about this for a line in Prague&#8217;s Stalin Square: frontside halfcab heel, backside nosegrind, frontside 5-0 treflip out, and a frontside varial backfoot heelflip. DAAAMMMNNN!!! And you know what, the best thing is that he makes it all look like so much fun. Check the ender! Jonny rules!</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/flD8QjZTExQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Jonny rides for <a href=\"http://www.reviveskateboards.com\" target=\"_blank\">Revive Skateboards</a>, Force Wheels and <a href=\"http://www.silvertrucks.com\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Trucks</a>.</p>\n","author":"kev","categories":["rdmn"],"tags":["jonny-giger","switzerland"],"featuredImages":[{"file":"Jonny-Giger-2.png","width":1092,"height":592,"mime_type":"image/png","source_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Jonny-Giger-2.png"}],"video":""}
