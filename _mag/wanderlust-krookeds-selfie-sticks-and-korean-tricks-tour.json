And the occasional selfie stick trick shot. Yup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1029 alignright\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-boneless.png\" alt=\"Mike Anderson boneless\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-boneless.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-boneless.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-boneless.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-boneless.png 1226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Sebo Walker has some really chill lines in the video, we especially like his night line with a nollie heel front lip(YES he can!!) on a natural bank to flatbar followed by a backtail bigspin on a wooden bench.</p>\n<p>Mike Anderson makes bonelesses look really fun, and Bobby Worrest crushes it with frontboards down a steep ass rail. Jake Johnson has a really chill 50-50 on what looks like a marble kinked hubba.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/krak/id916474561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-1030 alignleft\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-ollie.png\" alt=\"Mike Anderson ollie\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_300/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-ollie.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1024/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-ollie.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/w_1080/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-ollie.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/krak/image/upload/mag/uploads/Mike-Anderson-ollie.png 1093w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Seoul definitely seems to have spots for days, and the video&#8217;s vibe is clearly one of  all around fun clocking in at just under 6 minutes.
