                    We‚Äôre a bunch of skateboarders. Hungry to make sure skateboarding keeps its roots deep in
                    creativity, openness, rebellion and freedom. Foolish to believe we can build and own this
                    altogether, independantly, collectively.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our mission is twofold:
                    <br />
                    (a) make more skateboarding happen in this world.
                    <br />
                    (b) archive and save every piece, corner, moment of our culture.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And we want to achieve this by creating a proper common good. You can think of us as if Wikipedia,
                    OpenStreetMap, Thrasher and a DAO had a baby.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Wikipedia? yep! We are building a free online skateboarding encyclopedia written and maintained by
                    a community of passionate skateboarders through open collaboration.
                    <br />
                    - OpenStreetMap? yep! We are building a free, editable map of the whole world that is being built by
                    passionate skateboarders largely from scratch and released with an open-content license.
                    <br />
                    - Thrasher? yep! We are building a full skateboarding centric publication.
                    <br />
                    - DAO? yep! We are building a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our forever promise? To make Krak a community asset, 100% owned by skateboarders, workers and the
                    community.

                    redefine the world around you. It‚Äôs a way of getting out of house, connecting with other people, and
                    looking at the world through different sets of eyes.‚Äù Every word feels equally important in these
                    sentences. As long as skateboarding stayed a kind of underground culture, this was the way everyone
                    experienced it.

                    Along the way - and across 40 years at least - skateboarding grew bigger and bigger and started to
                    hugely influence more industries.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - In fashion, Supreme, which started as a little skateshop in Manhattan back in 1994, sold for $2bn+
                    to VF Corp at the end of 2020.
                    <br />
                    - In luxury, Virgil Abloh - RIP - ex Louis Vuitton creative director, used to be a skater and got a
                    lot of his inspiration from the community.
                    <br />
                    - In culture, Tony Hawk Pro Skater is still one of the most sold ever video-game series in sports.
                    <br />- In art, look at what{' '}
                    <a href="https://theskateroom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        The Skate Room{' '}
                    </a>
                    is doing: selling $500 decks with paintings from Basquiat on them.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All of this new acquired fame and influence attracted the biggest corporations of our world - Nike,
                    Adidas, Red Bull, the list is endless - and it turned skateboarding into an official Olympic Sport -
                    first appearance in Tokyo in 2021, second will be in Paris in 2024, and it‚Äôs already been confirmed
                    in LA in 2028.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is cool of course but it also distorted the whole skateboarding landscape. Now we get on one
                    side big corps with the economical and political influence to decide whatever they want - and they
                    don‚Äôt make anything for the culture per se, their incentive is crystal clear: sell more sugar cans,
                    shoes and so on. They‚Äôre the ones deciding who gets paid in skateboarding [few pro‚Äôs - poorly
                    treated though; even fewer filmers and photographers ‚Äî more poorly treated]; which parks to build,
                    where etc.
                    <br />
                    On the other side, we get tons of DIY [Do It Yourself] initiatives, locally rooted, led by extremely
                    ressourceful people, who spend all their energy for free because they do all this just for the
                    passion. They have no economical power. No political influence. While they‚Äôre the ones cementing the
                    community.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Krak aspires to unite all of these passionate people. Collectively, we could have more economical
                    power and political influence than any big corp. We could welcome 100x more people in the community,
                    offering them a way to make a life out of it. We could create physical spaces [plaza, parks, rooms
                    etc] around the world and offer them as safe and thriving hubs for the people. Possibilities are
                    endless.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Krak is a labour of love. It‚Äôs about passion. It‚Äôs about time.

                    When you ride somewhere, you leave an imprint. But at the speed things are now going, how can we
                    remember all the tricks done on a specific spot? and what about all the tricks on all the famous
                    spots worldwide?

                    Skateboarding evolves faster and faster and a lot of stuff will be forgotten and lost forever if not
                    documented. There‚Äôs something special with skatespots. Spots have history, context, and feel alive.
                    Krak is about annotating the streets somehow.

                    Places are like people: they have personality and character. They are complicated and endlessly
                    interesting; we can and do fall in love with places just as we do with people.
                    <br />
                    When people feel richly connected to the places where they live, work, and play they will invest
                    more of themselves in those places. They will participate in civic life, engage in the issues that
                    shape the future. The connection of people to a place‚Äîagain, to the land itself, to the cultures
                    people have created there, and to the buildings people have built there‚Äîis a form of social capital,
                    perhaps the single most important factor in whether a real community exists in a place.
                    <br />
                    To have healthy places, we must find ways to keep alive what is distinctive and emotionally
                    compelling there, which begins in understanding what those things are.

                    Old videos can be hard to find online and quality can be heartbreaking. Sometimes video parts get
                    deleted when pro‚Äôs switch sponsors. We‚Äôve been dreaming of such a wiki-ABD kind of map and it will
                    surely help the younger generations to be aware of the past and add their own local scene videos and
                    write history themselves.

                    <br />
                    On a larger scale, archiving skatespots worldwide has always felt important to us. How to make sure
                    our culture survives centuries? milleniums?

                    So at some point, we‚Äôve been like ‚Äòsure, why not‚Äô. Let‚Äôs archive the culture and try to make it last

                    Krak has been managed by a core team of 5 people since 2014. We received tons of help along the way
                    and at its peak, in 2018, there were 10 of us working full time.

                    Kev dreamt about Krak for the past 20+ years, literally. He grew up between Lyon and Paris and got
                    lost during every school holidays whith his board under his arm because his mother brought him and
                    his brothers in a new little town, somewhere in the french countryside. Where were the other
                    skaters? Where are the spots?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    He started working on Krak in late 2013, while he was living in Singapore. Max joined him in the
                    first half of 2014 and both of them moved to LA during that summer to launch the company. Simon
                    spent his life skateboarding and filming others, literally. As a filmer responsible for trips, he
                    spent countless hours mapping their destination [which he continues to do nowadays by the way]. He
                    joined Krak in early 2015. He also launched Silence Skateboards during that period.

                    to Krak on a weekly basis. Beyond us though, there is a community of 25 people, passionated, and
                    dedicated to skateboarding and its culture. They are developers, designers, entrepreneurs, hustlers.
                    Watching the level of energy of such a small group, we started dreaming about the impact 150 of us

                    This feels like ages ago. We‚Äôre late 2013 / early 2014 and we built a 3D printed prototype of a
                    hardware device that we attached to our board - right under the truck axle - that tracked every
                    motion of the board to recognize which tricks we had just landed.

                    We went through many names at that time as well: trcksy, indy trackers, wodd, krack, krak. That name

                    I realised we called our very first app: iOS Summer üòé¬†This one is so close to our hearts. We now
                    count more than 25,000 skatespots added to the database by the community.
                    <br />
                    And if I look in the past 6 months, we got between +10 and +800 new spots added per week. But the
                    database isn‚Äôt spots only. It‚Äôs also countless footages uploaded by skateboarders and specifically
                    attached to the spots. That‚Äôs how we know who ride where, landed what exactly and much more.
                    <br />
                    And if ‚Äúa picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù imagine what pictures-in-motion is worth exactly. Enjoy
                    some footages uploaded into the app.

                    We launched mid-2015 the very first subscription box for skateboarders. For $39, people would
                    receive every 2 month a mistery package - full of skateboarding paraphernalia. Think components,
                    accessories, cultural stuff, apparel, electronics, art and more. In 2018, we were sending 2,000
                    boxes around the world: US, Canada, across 12 countries in Europe and in Australia.
                    <br />

                    We designed and wrote our own skate zine. We always included a printed version into every KrakBox
                    mix we shipped. The content itself revolved around the stuff in the mix, the brands and the people
                    behind the brands.

                    It‚Äôs funny because we always heard things like "kids nowadays don‚Äôt read. And worst, they‚Äôd never
                    read on papers." so we tried once: we didn‚Äôt print the zine and didn‚Äôt include it in a mix. We got

                    skateboard media. We spent some time in Tampa, FL with him, we met few times around the world like
                    in LA, Berlin and Denver.

                    That app was very different than what we used to develop. You can think of it as a friendly

                    to record their session, what they‚Äôve landed, how they felt and much more.

                    Like launching your THPS playlist when you start riding, automatically ping your crew when you reach

                    One day we were wondering which kind of digital tools we could add to the suite to empower
                    skateboarders or just enhance their own experience of the culture. Like too many times we landed on
                    Youtube and started watching few videos. And as always, we started complaining about the algorithm
                    and the overcrowded interface that just wants to make you stick in there forever. That‚Äôs when it
                    clicked. What about a feed of skateboarding video, introduced chronologically, and that‚Äôs it.
                    Nothing more. That‚Äôs how{' '}

                    passionate folks. Again: no reco, just the titles and articles by order of release date. You can

                    And since we are heavy believers of the map as the perfect medium to explore skateboarding, we
                    started playing with what we call ‚Äòcustom maps‚Äô ‚Äî or specific theme-based maps. Here‚Äôs one of our

                    which is both at the same time a blessing and the most challenging mission ever ‚Äî then COVID broke
                    out. So we felt the need to slow down, pause for a little while and recharge.

                    In 2020, we decided to embrace a 100% communal move. We‚Äôve done everything for the love of the
                    culture and community so we started to wonder: what more could we do to definitely turn this journey
                    into a proper collective one? After all, our only 'raison d‚Äôetre' is to add value to the community,
                    not extracting some from it. So the main question became: what can we give to the skateboarding
                    community? and not: what can we get?

                    We‚Äôre still deep into that transition; which takes many forms:
                    <br />- open source the whole tech stack
                    <br />- converting the company itself [the legal structure] into a co-op

                <S.CallTiAdventureQuote>
                    1) Culture isn't made overnight ‚Äî it‚Äôs created over time and through dialogue.
                    <br />
                    2) Cultures and subcultures aren‚Äôt created through a single moment, they‚Äôre created through a
                    catalog of activity.
                    <br />
                    3) Cultural shifts are often outcomes of collective effort.

                    In the internet culture era our new institutions are still being formed, but what‚Äôs become clear is
                    that our primary challenge today is sifting through all the ideas, cultural norms, and potential
                    paths forward made possible by the web. This has made the curator (or the aggregator) an
                    increasingly powerful form. More and more these curators are using a new format to promote their
                    work: a form I call the culture label.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are many kinds of labels: record labels, fashion labels, publishing houses, art galleries,
                    production companies, and so on.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To date, we‚Äôve thought about the different kinds of labels as distinct from each other. Rarely do we
                    see a book publisher and a record label compared that deeply because their industries are so
                    different. But both are fundamentally doing the same thing.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A label looks out into the world with a specific point of view they‚Äôre looking to manifest through
                    projects they apply their resources to. If they‚Äôre a label that specializes in grizzly horror movies
                    or that releases specific microgenres of electronic music from certain regions, this is the lens
                    through which they see the world and ultimately the lens they‚Äôre inviting other people to see the
                    world through, too.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When we see the work of labels from this wider view, we get a better sense of what they‚Äôre doing:
                    they‚Äôre creating culture based on their lens, incrementally, with each release they make. By
                    bringing together the resources the projects in their worlds need (funding, collaborators,
                    materials, curatorial attention), labels help projects they‚Äôre culturally aligned with while putting
                    them in a context that creates more understanding for the work.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Culture labels reflect and project a desired reality onto the world.

                    Most startups aim for an "exit‚Äù like getting acquired or going public, but these ownership
                    transitions often pit startup founders and investors against the health of their community. We're
                    enabling a new option, an Exit to Community ‚Äî a path for startups to become owned and controlled by
                    users, workers, and stakeholders who value and depend on the startup. With E2C, the businesses
                    become a way to advance economic justice as a commons, not a commodity for investors to buy and
                    sell.
                </S.CallTiAdventureQuote>
                <S.CallToAdventureBody>
                    How not to genuinely aim for this when you read these lines? We are part of the community for more
                    than 20 years now [well, one current member could even claim 40 years haha]; we started building for
                    this community more than 8 years ago. I can tell you it is painful to see some people, brands,
                    tools, products, titles [you name it] just come and go for economic reasons. We‚Äôve seen countless
                    companies being launched with grandiose mission statements ‚Äî and a popular ‚Äòfor / by skateboarders‚Äô
                    to then be shut down or acquired by yet another big corp.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We‚Äôre also aligned with Ben Horowitz when he talked about joy and happiness:
                </S.CallToAdventureBody>
                <S.CallTiAdventureQuote>
                    In my experience there are really two things that lead to happiness and everything else is mostly
                    noise. The two things are contribution and abundance.
                    <br />
                    Contribution is basically exactly as it sounds. If you can align your life with where you have the
                    talent to make a large, meaningful, and real contribution to the world, your circle, or your family,
                    then you can be very happy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    An easy way to think of abundance is that it‚Äôs the anti-hater/anti-jealous mindset. If you believe
                    there is plenty in the world for everyone and you are always happy to see people who contribute
                    succeed, then you become part of ‚Äúteam contribution.‚Äù You don‚Äôt worry that someone is getting ahead
                    of you at work or that someone made a lot of money or that someone is better looking than you,
                    because you believe in abundance over scarcity and you can focus on maximizing your contribution. In
                    fact, their joy can become your joy (then you have an abundance of joy :-)). The good news is that
                    abundance is actually true. There is plenty in the world for everyone and once you see that, there
                    are so many ways to contribute.
                </S.CallTiAdventureQuote>
                <S.CallToAdventureBody>
                    We are definitely team contribution. We love the culture too much. Some things shouldn‚Äôt be built
                    and managed by a ‚Äòstartup‚Äô or another classic company. So rather than being a corporation that
                    exists to maximize shareholder value, Krak becomes a cooperative owned by its members for the
                    benefit of the members and the whole community.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you‚Äôre curious to know how we plan to organize Krak, the co-op, don‚Äôt look further than the{' '}

                    . This is our playbook.

                    <br />
                    And to explicit right here what is a Co-op exactly:
                </S.CallToAdventureBody>
                <S.CallTiAdventureQuote>
                    A cooperative is a collectively owned enterprise that serves the interests of its members. This
                    means a company owned by its workers, customers, or both.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Co-ops are for-profit, private enterprises. The primary distinction is that the shareholders in
                    co-ops are its workers or customers‚Äînot its investors and founders. This means that the company‚Äôs
                    profits are distributed back to its members, instead of to a singular owner or group of executives.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - Co-ops are controlled by their members. In addition to profit sharing, cooperative member-owners
                    are given a voice in business decisions.
                    <br />
                    <br />- Co-ops are a constructive alternative. Historically, co-ops have emerged when markets have
                    failed to meet the needs of a particular community, or to correct markets that have consolidated
                    into monopolies or monopsonies. When the government or private market fails to provide solutions,
                    collective actions are needed.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Co-ops are the answer when people organize and say, ‚ÄúIf no one is going to build this for us, we‚Äôll
                    build it for ourselves.‚Äù
                </S.CallTiAdventureQuote>
                <S.CallToAdventureBody>
                    You can think of DAOs as native internet-based co-ops, managed async, remotely and across the globe
                    [not necessarily though] and powered by code ‚Äî with the use of smart contracts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We like the efficiency of such a structure. We also plan to launch a token [our own currency; and
                    NFTs] that rewards everyone who‚Äôs participating. Imagine a local council around a specific spot made
                    of people who care about the place: they ride it of course but not only; they also document it
                    [photographers, filmers, writers‚Ä¶], clean it, re-build it, gather the community on it, enlive it,
                    paint it, cook for everyone ‚Äî in other words ‚Äî they magnify it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We believe in that DAO + Co-op duo‚Äôs potential to restore trust and enable new kinds of governance
                    where the community collectively makes important decisions & benefits from the value created as a
                    whole.

                    Krak is in the business of universe creation.
                    <br />
                    <br />I remember few years ago someone asking me why we added ‚ÄòStudio‚Äô to the name of the company.
                    Back then we were living in Venice, CA and had just spent a whole day at Universal Studios. I
                    replied: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on a mission to turn the world into a huge skatepark‚Äù so in an ideal scenario, the
                    company exists just as a space to empower people ‚Äî skateboarders ‚Äî to launch products for the
                    community; like a Hollywood studio works with directors on a specific movie [without being defined
                    only by this or that title].

                    Humans have always been involved in creating, affirming, or following cultural norms, knowingly or

                    Skateboarders care about the streets. They go out, explore, hack the original purpose of the urban
                    environment and make fun out of it. Outside is a playground for us.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Skateboarding is an expression of beauty, skateboarders open minds ‚Äî of everyone, riders or not ‚Äî
                    you could look at how people gather in crowd when they see a skater jumping on handrails; it is
                    amazing to watch this type of curiosity and energy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is a whole culture. It is a community. When we travel, the dream is to crash in another skater‚Äôs
                    place, getting to explore the city with the locals, eating / drinking where they have their habits.
                    <br />

                    Krak should become impossible to explain actually. We build a multilayered experience across the
                    skateboarding world, including offline-online bridges, visual, digital, and physical goods.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Krak is a community-owned and -ran experiential brand. We explore ‚Äî collectively ‚Äî at the
                    intersection of culture, art, history, style, web3, brands and businesses.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Krak is an incubator for community ideas. Krak creates a common good for the whole community, truly
                    owned by everyone. Let‚Äôs provide the foundational building blocks for the rest of the community to
                    play with, get their inspiration from, use, build on.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Now imagine if we succeed to:
                    <br />
                    <br />- provide a basic income to 1,000 people so they would live off skateboarding
                    <br />
                    <br />- own a network of parks and rooms across the world so members could always travel, ride and
                    crash for free
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We play the long game and we‚Äôre thinking about Krak in a 100 years lifetime.
