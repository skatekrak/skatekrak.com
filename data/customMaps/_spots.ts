It all started with one live webcam in Brussels I used to check to see if the floor was dry downtown after it rained. It’s on a spot that is really crowdy all the time so you can actually see if it’s the right time to skate. I found out there was some other plazas, skateparks, or smaller spots worldwide with webcams. Imagine if you could film a part using them!

After last winter when the pandemic came around, Harry Billiet started filming his homies. Turned out they all killed it non-stop for a whole year so the project naturally became a real team video with the support of Vans. Most of the scenes are in Belgium instead of some in Luxemburg and Marseille.
The video speaks for itself. These three Betties battled together through lockdowns.
